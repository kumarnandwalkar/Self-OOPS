    /*
    in java we can do inheritance using single level and multilevel inheritance
    but we cannot do multiple inheritance
    that is
    class c extends b,
    class b extends a,
    here class c will have all the properties of class a and b
    but we cannot do
    class c extends a and b
    this is not possible, it will cause ambiguity
    two or more classes cannot be inherited in one class but one class can be inherited in multiple classes
