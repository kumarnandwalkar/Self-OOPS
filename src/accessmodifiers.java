public class accessmodifiers
{
//    public
//    public can be accessed from anywhere, inside the class, outside the class, inside package outside package, inside a
//    subclass, outside a subclass everywhere

//    private
//    private can only be accessed inside the same class, not even any other class of the same package can access it, nor even
//    extended subclasses of the same package access it

//    default
//    this can be accessed only inside the same package
//    when we do not have anything before the datatype of variable (i.e is public private) it is treated as default

//    protected
//    protected can not be used outside the package but can only be used if it is beign called in a subclass outside the package,
//    and it is only accessable in the same package


//    pro tip:
//    we should always keep our instance variable as private , classes as public (note:there can only be one public class inside
//    a file) should avoid using default access modifier, should prefer using protected for methodes so that we can inherit our
//    class outside the package and can access the methode specifically
//
